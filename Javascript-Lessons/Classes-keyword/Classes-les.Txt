CLASSES 

Classes are a template fir creating objects They encapsulates data with code to work on that data.
 Classes in js are built on prototype but also have some Syntax and semantics that are not shared with  ES5 class like semantics.



 DEFINING CLASSES

Classes are in fact "specail function " and just as you can define function expression and function declarations the classes syntax has two component class expressions and class declarations


CLASS declarations
One way to define a class keyword with name of the class ("RECTANGLE" here ).
example code 
class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}


Hoisting 

An important difference between function declarations and class declarations
is that while functions can be defined before they can be constructed code like following 

example code 
const p = new Rectangle(); // ReferenceError

class Rectangle {}


CLASS EXPRESSION
A Classes expression is another way to define  a  class .
Class expressions can be unnamed . The name given to a named class expression is local to the class's body . How ever it can be accessed via the name property 

example code 
// unnamed
let Rectangle = class {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
};
console.log(Rectangle.name);
// output: "Rectangle"

// named
Rectangle = class Rectangle2 {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
};
console.log(Rectangle.name);
// output: "Rectangle2"
